# Library-Browser
Library browser program in Java. Given a list of books, such as the one provided in books03.csv, this java program helps browse the list, by helping to search, add and remove individual or groups of books based on different parameters, such as author, title, ISBN, collection, etc. This library browser also features a help option, which solves most of the problems you could encounter using this program. With some effort, this program could also be adapted for any other kind of lists.
